# State — forge-pdm-mlops

Updated: 2026-06-26

## Current focus

**F1 (Data + features) — DONE.** The data layer regenerates the **full** dataset
from the canonical config when the generator is present, and falls back **loudly**
to the committed smoke fixture offline (ADR-001). The feature layer turns `readings`
into a leakage-safe modelling frame: signals-only inputs with a tested leakage
guard, era-NULL missingness preserved (no imputation), and a deterministic
**unit-grouped** train/test split. ADR-003 records the three guards. **15 tests
green offline.** (F0 — the runnable skeleton — closed at the prior boundary.)

## Done

- **Package skeleton** (`src/pdm_mlops/`): `__init__` (version only), `config.py`
  (paths, MLflow wiring, seeds, thresholds — one source of truth), `cli.py` (`pdm`
  with `--version` + `train`/`serve`/`flow`/`monitor` stubbed to point at their
  phase). `pyproject.toml` with core deps (numpy/pandas/pyarrow/scikit-learn/
  lightgbm/mlflow) + `dev`/`serve`/`ops`/`generate` extras; the `[generate]` extra
  pins `can-telemetry-forge==0.1.0`.
- **Canonical dataset config** (`configs/dataset.json`) — the single cross-machine
  source of truth (seed 42 / 90 days / 5min / 168h horizon). The full dataset
  regenerates identically on any machine from this + the pinned generator (ADR-001).
- **Offline smoke fixture** (`data/sample_readings.parquet`, ~185 KB) built by
  `scripts/build_sample.py` as a *strict reduction of the same canonical config*
  (14-day window, ~hourly stride, stratified 20-unit subsample, modelling columns,
  float32 + categoricals, zstd). 6,720 rows × 14 cols, 5.8% failure rate. **It is a
  smoke fixture only — never a training set** (ADR-001).
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Linux+Windows × 3.11/3.12, installs `[dev]`
  only, smoke-tests `pdm --version`, runs offline pytest. **`retrain.yml`**: the
  scheduled (cron) + manual cloud trigger surface for the F5 Prefect flow (a
  marked placeholder until F5).
- **Tests** (`tests/test_skeleton.py`): import, CLI help/stubs, fixture presence.
- **Docs**: CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP (F0–F6), ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS (ADR-001/002),
  this STATE. `.gitignore` (mlruns, generated data, reports; un-ignores the fixture).
- **GitHub repo metadata applied** to `JorgeEd13/forge-pdm-mlops` (description + 14
  topics live in the About sidebar); command recorded in `.github/REPO_META.md`.
  The repo exists on GitHub with git initialized (branch `main`, remote set, no
  commits yet — F0 is the first commit).

### F1 — Data + features (2026-06-26)

- **`data.py`** — `load_readings()` prefers **full regeneration** from
  `configs/dataset.json` via the pinned generator (`regenerate_full`, with a
  `season` override hook for the F5 drift loop); falls back to the committed fixture
  with a **loud** `UserWarning` when the generator is absent, or raises
  `GeneratorUnavailable` if fallback is disabled. Verified on the real path: 90-day
  full dataset = **3.47M rows × 134 units** in ~98 s.
- **`features.py`** — `prepare()` returns a frozen `Dataset` (X/y/groups train+test).
  Inputs are the 8 J1939 signals only; `assert_no_leakage` (tested to fire) blocks
  the target + `failure_mode`/`anomaly_type`/`is_outlier`. **Era-NULL preserved** (no
  imputation). **Unit-grouped** `GroupShuffleSplit` (seeded, 25% of units), asserted
  disjoint — full data splits 100/34 units, fixture splits its 20 units cleanly.
- **Tests** — `test_data.py` (5: fixture load, fallback warns, season flagged,
  no-fallback raises, full-path-not-touching-fixture via monkeypatch) +
  `test_features.py` (6: signals-only/leakage-fires, unit-disjoint, determinism,
  seed-drives-partition, era-NULL preserved, binary target). All offline.
- **ADR-003** records the leakage guard / era-NULL / unit-split policy.

## Next step (concrete)

**F2 — Train + track (MVP core).** Implement `models.py` (LogReg pipeline with
imputation+scaling + LightGBM, behind one `fit`/`predict_proba`), `train.py` (log
**both** to MLflow on the local file backend — params, ROC-AUC, the model artifact —
and return the winner), and wire `pdm train`. ADR-004 for the two-model comparison.
DoD: two tracked runs + a registered winner + a same-seed-same-metric test. Train on
the full regenerated dataset; tests stay offline on the fixture. See ROADMAP F2.

One phase per session — F1 closes at this boundary for review before F2 starts.

## Notes

- No GPU, no paid services, no training tokens — local NumPy/pandas + cheap models;
  MLflow on a local file backend; CI is free and offline.
- Determinism is a hard invariant: one seed → data → split → train, same metrics.
- The fixture vs. the full dataset distinction is load-bearing (ADR-001): clone-and-
  run convenience without ever reporting metrics off the reduced slice.

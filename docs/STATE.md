# State — forge-pdm-mlops

Updated: 2026-06-27

## Current focus

**Data realism refresh — generator `can-telemetry-forge` 0.1.0 → 0.2.0 (cross-repo).**
Consuming the generator exposed that its failures had **no temporal signature** (a
failing unit's pre-failure rows were identical to its healthy rows), so a per-row model
scored ≈ 0.55 *by construction* — not for lack of modelling effort here. Fixed **in the
generator** (its ADR-020: a progressive pre-failure degradation ramp), not by tuning the
model against the data. Two changes landed on this side: (1) the `[generate]` pin moved
to `==0.2.0` and the committed smoke fixture was **rebuilt** against it; (2) `vibration_mms`
(the bearing signature, era-gated, previously unused) was added to `features.FEATURE_COLUMNS`
— it also flows into `detect.SIGNAL_COLUMNS` automatically. **Measured on a regenerated
dataset: ≈ 0.55 → 0.73 (ramp alone) → ≈ 0.82 (with vibration).** Two generator hazard
rebalances were prototyped, scored, and **rejected** (neither beat the ramp; logged in the
generator's ADR-020). The earlier "score is faint by design / ~0.55" framing in F2/F2.5/F2.6
is now **superseded** — the score is a real ≈ 0.82, earned from raw sensors with the
leakage guards intact. (F2–F2.6 process/instrumentation claims are unchanged and now sit on
honestly-learnable data.) Re-run `pdm train` to refresh the registered metrics.

**F2.6 (Tune + diagnose — instrumentation) — DONE.** On the F2.5-**cleaned** inputs
(`features.prepare(suspect_feature=True)`), "why this model, with these params" is now
**visible, tracked, and guarded** — deliberately *not* an accuracy play, now **measured**:
on the refreshed 0.2.0 data HPO moves the held-out test AUC by **+0.003 (lightgbm) / 0.000
(logreg)** — the real ≈0.82 came from the data (ADR-020), not the tuning (ADR-006). Three
pieces:

- **HPO (`tune.py`)** — one seeded **Optuna** study per contender over a *restricted,
  declared* tunable space (`models.LOGREG_TUNABLE`/`LIGHTGBM_TUNABLE`), scored by
  **unit-grouped `GroupKFold`** on the *training* split only, so the search can't leak a
  unit across folds (ADR-003 holds) and never tunes against the reported test number.
  Tracked to a `-tune` MLflow experiment; `pdm tune` runs it; tuned params feed
  `train(tuned=…)`. New `[tune]` extra (`optuna` + optional `matplotlib`).
- **Diagnostics (`diagnostics.log_diagnostics`)** — per fitted model, **artifacts** on its
  MLflow run: feature importance (`signal_suspect` ranks), calibration, a precision/recall
  threshold sweep, a learning curve. **CSV always** (CI-light, reproducible) + **PNG when
  matplotlib is present** — matplotlib is an optional nicety, never a hard dep.
- **Training watchers (`diagnostics.audit_fit`, opt-in `--audit`)** — the forensic-watcher
  pattern: an **overfit-gap** guard (train − grouped-CV AUC > 0.15) and a
  **majority-baseline** guard (test AUC must beat 0.5). Raise `FitAudit` in strict mode.
  `DegenerateSplit` (F2) is the third in this family.

**An honest finding, kept (not hidden).** On the **15-unit smoke fixture** the deep
LightGBM legitimately overfits — train AUC ≈ 1.0 vs. grouped-CV ≈ 0.60 → the overfit-gap
watcher **trips**. That is the watcher *earning its keep*, not a bug: grouped CV on so few
units is pessimistic by construction (the same fixture-size artifact ADR-004 records for
`DegenerateSplit`). A dedicated test asserts the trip on the fixture; the watcher's *pass*
path is tested on a shallow/regularised fit; the honest setting is the full 100-unit
dataset. **`pdm train --tune --audit --diagnose` chains all three live.** **63 tests green
offline** (49 from F0–F2.5 + 14 new). ADR-006.

**F2.5 (Outlier robustness — clean first) — DONE.** A three-rung detection ladder
(`detect.py`) — multivariate (IsolationForest + robust Mahalanobis), temporal
(exact-value freeze runs + sustained monotone creep, with the detectable signals chosen
**unsupervised** at fit time), and a CPU-only PyTorch autoencoder — each **scored against
the generator's ground-truth labels** (`detect_score.py`), which are read in exactly one
place to *grade* (and to tune the temporal constants), never as a detector input or a
model feature (the ADR-003 leakage guard holds, asserted by test). The autoencoder
**earns its place** (best overall, beats the cheap rungs on subtle recall). The temporal
rung is a **deliberate rewrite**: its first rolling-variance/slope form scored ~0.02 F1
and flagged >85 % of rows; the diagnosis became the fix, and the negative result is
logged in ADR-005. Output = a leakage-safe **`signal_suspect`** feature
(`suspect.add_signal_suspect`, opt-in via `features.prepare(suspect_feature=True)`) + a
**data-quality watcher** (`suspect.data_quality_check`, forensic-watcher pattern, doubles
as an F5 drift signal). `pdm detect` prints the scored table. New `[deep]` torch extra,
out of core CI. **49 tests green offline** (27 from F0–F2 + 22 new). ADR-005.

**F2 (Train + track — MVP core) — DONE.** `pdm train` now runs an honest
**two-model comparison** (LogReg pipeline + LightGBM behind one interface), logs
**both** as MLflow runs (params + ROC-AUC + the fitted model artifact), picks the
winner by the primary metric, and **registers** it in the MLflow Model Registry —
all on a server-free local **SQLite** backend (ADR-004). Deterministic: same seed →
same metrics. **27 tests green offline** (15 from F0/F1 + 12 new). This is the MVP
core; F3 builds gated promotion/rollback on the same registry.

**F1 (Data + features) — DONE.** The data layer regenerates the **full** dataset
from the canonical config when the generator is present, and falls back **loudly**
to the committed smoke fixture offline (ADR-001). The feature layer turns `readings`
into a leakage-safe modelling frame: signals-only inputs with a tested leakage
guard, era-NULL missingness preserved (no imputation), and a deterministic
**unit-grouped** train/test split. ADR-003 records the three guards. (F0 — the
runnable skeleton — closed at an earlier boundary.)

## Done

- **Package skeleton** (`src/pdm_mlops/`): `__init__` (version only), `config.py`
  (paths, MLflow wiring, seeds, thresholds — one source of truth), `cli.py` (`pdm`
  with `--version` + `train`/`serve`/`flow`/`monitor` stubbed to point at their
  phase). `pyproject.toml` with core deps (numpy/pandas/pyarrow/scikit-learn/
  lightgbm/mlflow) + `dev`/`serve`/`ops`/`generate` extras; the `[generate]` extra
  pins `can-telemetry-forge==0.1.0`.
- **Canonical dataset config** (`configs/dataset.json`) — the single cross-machine
  source of truth (seed 42 / 90 days / 5min / 168h horizon). The full dataset
  regenerates identically on any machine from this + the pinned generator (ADR-001).
- **Offline smoke fixture** (`data/sample_readings.parquet`, ~185 KB) built by
  `scripts/build_sample.py` as a *strict reduction of the same canonical config*
  (14-day window, ~hourly stride, stratified 20-unit subsample, modelling columns,
  float32 + categoricals, zstd). 6,720 rows × 14 cols, 5.8% failure rate. **It is a
  smoke fixture only — never a training set** (ADR-001).
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Linux+Windows × 3.11/3.12, installs `[dev]`
  only, smoke-tests `pdm --version`, runs offline pytest. **`retrain.yml`**: the
  scheduled (cron) + manual cloud trigger surface for the F5 Prefect flow (a
  marked placeholder until F5).
- **Tests** (`tests/test_skeleton.py`): import, CLI help/stubs, fixture presence.
- **Docs**: CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP (F0–F6), ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS (ADR-001/002),
  this STATE. `.gitignore` (mlruns, generated data, reports; un-ignores the fixture).
- **GitHub repo metadata applied** to `JorgeEd13/forge-pdm-mlops` (description + 14
  topics live in the About sidebar); command recorded in `.github/REPO_META.md`.
  The repo exists on GitHub with git initialized (branch `main`, remote set, no
  commits yet — F0 is the first commit).

### F1 — Data + features (2026-06-26)

- **`data.py`** — `load_readings()` prefers **full regeneration** from
  `configs/dataset.json` via the pinned generator (`regenerate_full`, with a
  `season` override hook for the F5 drift loop); falls back to the committed fixture
  with a **loud** `UserWarning` when the generator is absent, or raises
  `GeneratorUnavailable` if fallback is disabled. Verified on the real path: 90-day
  full dataset = **3.47M rows × 134 units** in ~98 s.
- **`features.py`** — `prepare()` returns a frozen `Dataset` (X/y/groups train+test).
  Inputs are the 8 J1939 signals only; `assert_no_leakage` (tested to fire) blocks
  the target + `failure_mode`/`anomaly_type`/`is_outlier`. **Era-NULL preserved** (no
  imputation). **Unit-grouped** `GroupShuffleSplit` (seeded, 25% of units), asserted
  disjoint — full data splits 100/34 units, fixture splits its 20 units cleanly.
- **Tests** — `test_data.py` (5: fixture load, fallback warns, season flagged,
  no-fallback raises, full-path-not-touching-fixture via monkeypatch) +
  `test_features.py` (6: signals-only/leakage-fires, unit-disjoint, determinism,
  seed-drives-partition, era-NULL preserved, binary target). All offline.
- **ADR-003** records the leakage guard / era-NULL / unit-split policy.

### F2 — Train + track (2026-06-26)

- **`models.py`** — two contenders behind one `Model` (`fit`/`predict_proba`):
  `build_logreg` (median-impute → scale → `LogisticRegression`, `class_weight=
  balanced`; imputation lives **in the pipeline** so era-NULL stays intact upstream)
  and `build_lightgbm` (`LGBMClassifier`, native NaN, no scaling). `build_all` returns
  them in fixed order. Each carries a flat `params` dict for MLflow.
- **`train.py`** — `train()` loops `build_all`, opens an **MLflow run** per model
  (params + ROC-AUC + the model artifact), picks the best `roc_auc`, and **registers**
  the winner. Local **SQLite** tracking/registry (`config.sqlite_tracking_uri`),
  injectable data source (`readings=`/`load=`) so tests stay offline. `_score` raises
  **`DegenerateSplit`** if the test set is single-class (a fixture-only artifact — the
  full split is class-rich) instead of logging a meaningless `nan`.
- **`pdm train`** — wired live (`--seed`, `--no-register`); prints a comparison table.
- **ADR-004** — two-model comparison; SQLite backend (MLflow 3 retired the bare file
  store); sklearn artifacts via cloudpickle (skops rejects `numpy.dtype`); the
  `DegenerateSplit` guard.
- **Tests** — `test_models.py` (7: both fit & emit proba, one interface, era-NULL fed
  in raw, LightGBM eats NaN, LogReg pipeline imputes, same-seed-same-fit) +
  `test_train.py` (5: two tracked runs + registered winner, `--no-register` skips the
  registry, same-seed-same-metric, defaults to the data loader, `DegenerateSplit`
  fires on the degenerate fixture seed). MLflow → tmp SQLite; all offline.

### F2.5 — Outlier robustness (2026-06-26)

- **`detect.py`** — the ladder behind one `Detector` surface (`fit`/`score` → a
  `[0,1]` suspicion per row, **label-free**): `MultivariateDetector` (IsolationForest +
  `MinCovDet` Mahalanobis, `support_fraction=0.9`), `TemporalDetector` (exact-value
  freeze runs ≥ `STUCK_MIN_RUN` on *unsupervised-selected* continuous signals + a
  sustained monotone-creep window on *non-monotone* signals), `AutoencoderDetector`
  (CPU torch, reconstruction error). `build_ladder`/`fit_score_all`.
- **`detect_score.py`** — reads the labels (the **only** place) to grade each rung:
  ROC-AUC + AP vs. `is_outlier`, per-`anomaly_type` recall at a **tie-aware** top-2%
  alarm budget (`_alarm_set` — a sparse detector can't win by flagging everything), and
  the **autoencoder-earns-its-place** verdict. `pdm detect` prints the table.
- **`suspect.py`** — `add_signal_suspect` (combines rungs → the leakage-safe
  `signal_suspect` column, re-passes the guard) wired into `features.prepare(
  suspect_feature=True)`; `data_quality_check` forensic watcher (raises
  `DataQualitySpike` in strict mode; F5 drift signal).
- **The temporal rewrite (ADR-005).** Rolling-variance/slope → stuck/drift scored ~0.02
  F1 and flagged >85% of rows; rewritten to the freeze-run / monotone-creep signatures
  with unsupervised signal eligibility → stuck recall ≈0.59 @ precision ≈0.64 on
  native-res, drift high-precision/low-recall. The negative result is documented, not
  hidden. Thresholds auto-derived vs. ground truth (with Jorge) then pinned.
- **`[deep]` extra** (CPU `torch`), kept out of core CI. **ADR-005.**
- **Tests** — `test_detect.py` (12: ranges, label-free proof, determinism, unsupervised
  signal selection, no-flag-everything, `_equal_run_lengths`, AE skip-if-no-torch),
  `test_detect_score.py` (6: grades well-formed, tie-aware budget dense+sparse, NaN for
  absent family, loud on missing labels), `test_suspect.py` (6: feature leakage-safe,
  `prepare` wiring, determinism, watcher fires + strict raises). **49 total green.**

### F2.6 — Tune + diagnose (2026-06-26)

- **`tune.py`** — `tune_model` runs a seeded **Optuna** study per contender over its
  restricted tunable space, objective = mean ROC-AUC over **unit-grouped `GroupKFold`**
  folds of the *training* split (single-class folds skipped; all-degenerate → `nan` →
  pruned). `tune` prepares the **cleaned** frame (`suspect_feature=True`), runs both
  studies, logs each to a `-tune` MLflow experiment, returns `{name: TuneResult}`.
  `DEFAULT_TRIALS=40`. The test split is never seen by the search.
- **`models.py`** — `build_logreg`/`build_lightgbm` take validated `overrides`
  (`_check_overrides` raises on an unknown key); with none they are the F2 baseline
  exactly. `BUILDERS` (name→builder) + `build_all(tuned=…)` feed tuned params by name.
- **`diagnostics.py`** — `log_diagnostics` writes feature-importance / calibration /
  threshold-sweep / learning-curve **artifacts** (CSV always + PNG if matplotlib) to the
  active run. `audit_fit` = overfit-gap (`OVERFIT_GAP_LIMIT=0.15`) + majority-baseline
  (`MAJORITY_AUC=0.5`) watchers → `AuditReport`, raise `FitAudit` in strict mode.
- **`train.py`** — gained `tuned=` / `clean=` (cleaned frame; defaults on when `tuned`
  given) / `audit=` (strict watchers) / `diagnose=` (artifacts); logs `cleaned_inputs`,
  `tuned`, and the audit's `cv_roc_auc`/`train_roc_auc`.
- **`cli.py`** — `pdm tune` (`--seed`, `--trials`) live; `pdm train` gained `--tune`
  (search then train tuned+cleaned), `--audit`, `--diagnose`, `--clean`.
- **`[tune]` extra** (`optuna` + optional `matplotlib`), out of core CI. **ADR-006.**
- **Tests** — `test_tune.py` (6: grouped CV never shares a unit, only-tunable params,
  tuned params build a model, determinism, one tracked run/model, searches the cleaned
  frame), `test_diagnostics.py` (7: importance ranks `signal_suspect`, artifacts land,
  watcher pass-path on a shallow fit, **fixture deep-fit trips overfit by design**,
  majority watcher fires + strict raises), + 2 in `test_train.py` (tuned params thread
  through on the cleaned frame; `--audit` raises). **63 total green.**

## Next step (concrete)

**F3 — Registry + promotion.** Governed model lifecycle on the same MLflow registry F2
already writes to. `registry.py`: register the winner, **stage→production promotion gated
by the eval metric**, and rollback. DoD: a *worse* candidate does **not** promote
(asserted); rollback restores the prior production version. ADR-007 (promotion gate).
Build it on the SQLite-backed registry (ADR-004) and the tuned winner F2.6 can now
produce. Tests stay offline (tmp SQLite, the fixture).

**Honesty note (carries forward) — now measured, not asserted.** The real lift came from
the **data**, not the modelling: ADR-020's pre-failure degradation ramp + the
`vibration_mms` feature took the score ≈0.55→0.82. **F2.6 HPO, measured on the refreshed
0.2.0 data (notebook, seed 42, same cleaned frame), does *not* move it:** tuned − baseline
held-out test ROC-AUC = **+0.0034 (lightgbm 0.8118→0.8152) / 0.0000 (logreg
0.7131→0.7131)**; grouped-CV search 0.7526 / 0.6767; both pass `--audit` (lightgbm overfit
gap train−CV = 0.880−0.753 = 0.127 < 0.15; logreg train≈CV≈test). The value across F2–F2.6
is the *visible, ground-truth-scored process + the guards*, not accuracy — and the near-zero
HPO delta is itself the honest, postable confirmation of that on realistically learnable
data.

One phase per session — F2.6 closes at this boundary for review before F3 starts.

## Notes

- No GPU, no paid services, no training tokens — local NumPy/pandas + cheap models;
  MLflow on a local file backend; CI is free and offline.
- Determinism is a hard invariant: one seed → data → split → train, same metrics.
- The fixture vs. the full dataset distinction is load-bearing (ADR-001): clone-and-
  run convenience without ever reporting metrics off the reduced slice.

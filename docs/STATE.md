# State — forge-pdm-mlops

Updated: 2026-06-25

## Current focus

**F0 (Foundations & runnable skeleton) — in progress.** Scaffolded the 4th public
showcase: the MLOps half of the `can-telemetry-forge` narrative. The skeleton
imports, the `pdm` CLI runs with honestly-stubbed subcommands, the canonical
dataset config and the offline smoke fixture are in place, and the CI + scheduled
retrain workflows are wired. ADR-001 (data coupling) and ADR-002 (the stack + why
both orchestrators) are recorded.

## Done

- **Package skeleton** (`src/pdm_mlops/`): `__init__` (version only), `config.py`
  (paths, MLflow wiring, seeds, thresholds — one source of truth), `cli.py` (`pdm`
  with `--version` + `train`/`serve`/`flow`/`monitor` stubbed to point at their
  phase). `pyproject.toml` with core deps (numpy/pandas/pyarrow/scikit-learn/
  lightgbm/mlflow) + `dev`/`serve`/`ops`/`generate` extras; the `[generate]` extra
  pins `can-telemetry-forge==0.1.0`.
- **Canonical dataset config** (`configs/dataset.json`) — the single cross-machine
  source of truth (seed 42 / 90 days / 5min / 168h horizon). The full dataset
  regenerates identically on any machine from this + the pinned generator (ADR-001).
- **Offline smoke fixture** (`data/sample_readings.parquet`, ~185 KB) built by
  `scripts/build_sample.py` as a *strict reduction of the same canonical config*
  (14-day window, ~hourly stride, stratified 20-unit subsample, modelling columns,
  float32 + categoricals, zstd). 6,720 rows × 14 cols, 5.8% failure rate. **It is a
  smoke fixture only — never a training set** (ADR-001).
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Linux+Windows × 3.11/3.12, installs `[dev]`
  only, smoke-tests `pdm --version`, runs offline pytest. **`retrain.yml`**: the
  scheduled (cron) + manual cloud trigger surface for the F5 Prefect flow (a
  marked placeholder until F5).
- **Tests** (`tests/test_skeleton.py`): import, CLI help/stubs, fixture presence.
- **Docs**: CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP (F0–F6), ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS (ADR-001/002),
  this STATE. `.gitignore` (mlruns, generated data, reports; un-ignores the fixture).
- **GitHub repo metadata applied** to `JorgeEd13/forge-pdm-mlops` (description + 14
  topics live in the About sidebar); command recorded in `.github/REPO_META.md`.
  The repo exists on GitHub with git initialized (branch `main`, remote set, no
  commits yet — F0 is the first commit).

## Next step (concrete)

**F1 — Data + features.** Implement `data.py` (regenerate the full dataset from
`configs/dataset.json`; loud fallback to the fixture when the generator is absent)
and `features.py` (era-`NULL` handling, a leakage guard, a **unit-grouped**
train/test split). Tests run on the committed fixture. See ROADMAP F1.

One phase per session — F0 closes at this boundary for review before F1 starts.

## Notes

- No GPU, no paid services, no training tokens — local NumPy/pandas + cheap models;
  MLflow on a local file backend; CI is free and offline.
- Determinism is a hard invariant: one seed → data → split → train, same metrics.
- The fixture vs. the full dataset distinction is load-bearing (ADR-001): clone-and-
  run convenience without ever reporting metrics off the reduced slice.
